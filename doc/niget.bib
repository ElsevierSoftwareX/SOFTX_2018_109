abstract = "Depth-sensing indentation instruments provide a means for studying the elastic and plastic properties of thin films. A method for obtaining hardness and Young's modulus from the data obtained from these types of instruments is described. Elastic displacements are determined from the data obtained during unloading of the indentation. Young's modulus can be calculated from these measurements. In addition, the elastic contribution to the total displacement can be removed in order to calculate hardness. Determination of the exact shape of the indenter at the tip is critical to the measurement of both hardness and elastic modulus for indentation depths less than a micron. Hardness is shown to depend on strain rate, especially when the hardness values are calculated from the data along the loading curves.",

abstract = "The continuously recording indentation responses of a number of coated systems, mainly thin (\&lt;10 μm) hard nitride coatings on stainless steels and a powder metallurgy tool steel, have been explored using nanoindentation with indenter displacements increasing progressively to values greater than the coating thickness. The resultant load-displacement data have been analyzed not only to produce conventional load-displacement (P-δ) plots but also to examine the relationship between P and δ2. Recent models have proposed that there should be a linear P-δ2 relationship for homogeneous systems and that such plots have the potential to reveal the load/displacement regimes in which either the coating or the substrate, or both, are dominant in controlling the overall behavior of the coated system. By utilizing point-to-point differentiation of the P-δ2 relationship, this paper extends this approach to confirm not only that these different regimes of behavior may be readily experimentally iden" # "tified in this way, but also that further details, such as the propagation of cracks, may be recognized. Our analysis also provides a valuable experimental link to models describing the near-surface deformation behavior of coated systems.",

  abstract={A range of mechanical properties of a coating/substrate system may be obtained using indentation tests, and with the emergence of continuously recording indentation testing with nanometre penetration (often called nanoindentation) the mechanical properties of very thin coatings (<1 µm) and surface treated layers may be measured. This paper reviews the deformation mechanisms which occur and the methods for extracting mechanical properties of coatings from nanoindentation load–displacement curves and introduces the differences observed when compared with the testing of bulk materials. The importance of the relative hardness of coating and substrate on the response of the system is highlighted, and the use of energy-based models for the prediction of the performance of single and multilayered systems is discussed.}
