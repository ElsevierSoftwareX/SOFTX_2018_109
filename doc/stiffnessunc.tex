%--------------------- uncertainties for stiffness method ------------------------------
 
 \subsubsection{Uncertainty propagation for stiffness analysis} \label{stiffness_unc}
The package ODRPACK does not allow to separate the contributions from depth and load uncertainty. 
The results which correspond to a fit using only the uncertainties in the depth, resp. load are shown instead of the contributions and 
the result from a fit using both uncertainties is shown instead of the combined uncertainty.
The uncertainties of $\kl$, $\ql$, $\ku$ and $\qu$ are obtained directly from ODRPACK, see \ref{odrpack_teorie_unc}
